# Linked List

## What is a linked list?

A set of nodes which has two elements: value and address pointer. First node refers to Head and Last node refers to Tail which has a null address pointer.
JavaScript doesn't come with built-in linked list whereas Java does.
We can play with the linked list in [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list).
